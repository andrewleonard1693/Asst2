Test 1:
	3 directories each with 3 files containing song lyrics. This is not too large of a test case but
	large enough to show that the indexer is working correctly recursively. 
Test 2:
	Pass in a file as the intial argument instead of a directory. This would be a special case for
	the initial start of the program. If the user passes in a file that is not a directory the 
	program needs to handle that.
Test 3:
	Pass in an empty file.
